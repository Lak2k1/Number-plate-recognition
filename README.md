# Number-plate-recognition
Recognise the number plate in a frame, and write the numbers of the number plate.

First we develop a model which detects number plates from an image. For that we use kaggle dataset with annotations. For the object detection we use the Tensorflow Objection Detection API, and the Tensorflow Model Zoo since they are all brilliantly trained for the purpose.

## So first we try to detect number plate in an image, using Tensorlfow Object Detection API.

## We then proceed to get the numbers on the number plate
